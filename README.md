# About get_next_line

This project is about writing a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor. If called in a loop, this function returns the entire content of a file, line by line, until it reaches the end of the file. Buffer size can be set at compilation. The key learning points of this project are: reading from a file descriptor and static variables.
